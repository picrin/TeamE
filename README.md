This is a project for PSD3 2013. The project is to create a system that will be used by the Computing Science Department 
to manage the timetable for the different sessions organised by the department and for attendance monitoring in these 
sessions. 

Currently our team members are: Adam Kurkiewicz, Arnas Gabrielius Šlepikas, Bruno Peres, Chris Meechan, 
Gabrielius Mickevičius and Vlad Tudor Bradu.
